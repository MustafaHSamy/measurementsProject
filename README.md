# measurementsProject


## Components
 - this project uses sensors (ntc, bmp180, ldr) to measure temperature, pressure, altitude, and light intensity.
 I know the ntc isn't required with the bmp180 but it was required from my college

## Output
- the input data is printed on an lcd 16*2 with different units depending on the state of the button
- the data of pressure, altitude, and temperature are shown for 8 seconds then <br> the light intesnsity reading is show for 2 seconds before showing the first again

## Changing units
- Each time you press the push button the units displayed are changed, first it show SI units, then American units,<br> then with more presses it shows the details of each parameter measured in all units
